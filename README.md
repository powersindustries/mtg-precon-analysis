### Magic the Gathering Preconfigured Commander Deck Analysis
This project contains analytics searches and calculations for all commander decks released by Wizards of the coast from 2023-2024. This repo acts as a companion piece for an episode of the Wild Dogs Podcast.

### Database
All cards can be found in a csv file labeled `cardDatabase.csv` within the `data` directory. The csv file uses the `;` character as their deliminator. The columns go in order of:
```
Name;Mana Cost;Type;Description;Color Identity;Sets;Decks
```
